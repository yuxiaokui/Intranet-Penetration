Cobalt Strike v3.0 - Advanced Threat Tactics Software
=============================================================================

1. What is Cobalt Strike?
   ----------------------

Cobalt Strike is software for Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations.

Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations are security assessments that 
replicate the tactics and techniques of an advanced adversary in a network. 
While penetration tests focus on unpatched vulnerabilities and 
misconfigurations, these assessments benefit security operations and incident
response.

Cobalt Strike gives you a post-exploitation agent and covert channels to 
emulate a quiet long-term embedded actor in your customer's network. 
Malleable C2 lets you change your network indicators to look like different 
malware each time. These tools complement Cobalt Strike's solid social 
engineering process, its robust collaboration capability, and unique reports 
designed to aid blue team training.

2. Documentation
   -------------

Documentation for Cobalt Strike is located on the Cobalt Strike website at:
http://www.advancedpentest.com. Read the FAQ and the Manual for information
on how to use Cobalt Strike. Watching the free online training is highly
encouraged as well.
